# KrusPrimDijkChomp
**Kruskal, Prim, Dijkstra, and CHOMP game**


This was for my MATH 300 Midterm - Where we implemented famous algorithm's (Prim's, Dijkstra's, and Kruskal's) and applied them to different graphs. I also implemented strategies for always winning (for only certain board sizes in Chomp).
